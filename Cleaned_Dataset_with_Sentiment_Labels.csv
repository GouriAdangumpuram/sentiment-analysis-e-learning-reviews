Udemy,Data Analysis with Pandas and Python,5,"Im currently following the final year of my BSc Data Science degree and currently working as a data scientist in a private sector company. Even if I was able to deal with machine learning and EDA with help of my academic studies and support of colleagues, I was not confident with the deep intuition Difficulthind models, professional level project implementation and clean coding. Content of this course gave me almost every aspect I was missing in term of knowledge, practical experience as well as professional mindset. The way of explaining things using pen and ipad was so much easier when it comes to understanding the things rather than explaining using a presentation slide. Every theory part comes with its own practical session as well and that helps to understand and gain the experience right at the moment of theory completion. Iâ€™ve bought the Generative AI course as well from Krish and hope that will explain how rich this content and his effort is. Thank Interesting Krish Naik",

Coursera,IBM Data Science,3,"The course teaches SQL quite well. But it doesn't teach and make practice about the connection to a database and use of sql magic.

Coursera,Foundations of Data Science,5,"This course focused on interpersonal skills and a structured PACE analysis activity. The videos were accessible, done by engaging instructors who were 'TV-ready' - great eye contact, speech patterns and teachers. There were additional lessons and interviews with data professionals that were interesting by bloated the time needed to complete this course.  Inspite of having good instructors, the course seemed to lack focus at times, and some topics were revisited multiple times, even after demonstrating competency. It was fustrating in the discusson forums to see some students completing assignments while others just entered a single word instead of uploading a document in order to pass out of the assignments. It makes on question the value of the certificate. Moreover, the instructions often required Interesting to revisit assignments and Difficult quizzed on the same interpersonal skill and project management ideas Interesting had demonstrated proficiency in. This wasn't done as a stepping stone to another source of information, but was just done in a way that was, at time, painfully redundant. I am a woman and I appreciate having women as instructors in this industry. That Difficulting said, only having women as the instructors in lessons on 'soft skills' may have Difficulten inclusive but signaled that Difficulting able to communicate, plan and work with colleagues professionally was not something men  value.
