# Sentiment Analysis of E-Learning Platforms Reviews using NLP and Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a sentiment analysis system to evaluate student reviews from e-learning platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and LinkedIn Learning. The goal is to assist students in selecting relevant courses and provide platforms with actionable insights.

## 📌 Objective
To classify student reviews as positive, neutral, or negative using traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches, while ensuring model transparency through Explainable AI.

## 📂 Dataset
- Manually scraped over 10,000 real reviews from Coursera, Udemy, and LinkedIn Learning.
- Cleaned and structured into a multi-source dataset for training and evaluation.

## 🔧 Preprocessing Techniques
- Text normalization
- Stop word removal
- Lemmatization
- TF-IDF and BERT embeddings

## 🧠 Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Naïve Bayes
- Random Forest
- LSTM (Keras)
- BERT (Hugging Face Transformers)

## 🏆 Results
- Best model accuracy: **78%** (BERT)
- Explainability: Integrated **SHAP** for interpretability and bias detection

## 📊 Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
- NLTK, SpaCy, Hugging Face Transformers
- SHAP, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Google Colab

## 🌐 Future Work
- Improve accuracy with ensemble models
- Expand dataset across more platforms
- Deploy as a web-based course recommendation tool
