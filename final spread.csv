Udemy,Data Analysis with Pandas and Python,Nilmantha V.,Rating: 5.0 out of 5,"Im currently following the final year of my BSc Data Science degree and currently working as a data scientist in a private sector company. Even if I was able to deal with machine learning and EDA with help of my academic studies and support of colleagues, I was not confident with the deep intuition behind models, professional level project implementation and clean coding. Content of this course gave me almost every aspect I was missing in term of knowledge, practical experience as well as professional mindset. The way of explaining things using pen and ipad was so much easier when it comes to understanding the things rather than explaining using a presentation slide. Every theory part comes with its own practical session as well and that helps to understand and gain the experience right at the moment of theory completion. Iâ€™ve bought the Generative AI course as well from Krish and hope that will explain how rich this content and his effort is. Thank you Krish Naik",

Instead of testing us out on a section, he lets you solve the problem based on what you've learned and then walk through a solution to that problem. You either know what to do or not.

Coursera,Foundations of Data Science, Beth a,Rating: 5.0 out of 5,"This course focused on interpersonal skills and a structured PACE analysis activity. The videos were accessible, done by engaging instructors who were 'TV-ready' - great eye contact, speech patterns and teachers. There were additional lessons and interviews with data professionals that were interesting by bloated the time needed to complete this course.  Inspite of having good instructors, the course seemed to lack focus at times, and some topics were revisited multiple times, even after demonstrating competency. It was fustrating in the discusson forums to see some students completing assignments while others just entered a single word instead of uploading a document in order to pass out of the assignments. It makes on question the value of the certificate. Moreover, the instructions often required you to revisit assignments and be quizzed on the same interpersonal skill and project management ideas you had demonstrated proficiency in. This wasn't done as a stepping stone to another source of information, but was just done in a way that was, at time, painfully redundant. I am a woman and I appreciate having women as instructors in this industry. That being said, only having women as the instructors in lessons on 'soft skills' may have been inclusive but signaled that being able to communicate, plan and work with colleagues professionally was not something men  value. It came off, at times, like having a lot of women in HR positions lecturing you. Based on the slow and repetitive nature of the material,  I couldn't recommend this course in it's current format.",

The content in the videos (many typos!!!!) are really valuable but the tasks man... Only the surface of the surface will be discussed, no deeping down into the wild. In this course the libraries numpy and pandas are presented but in the final assignment we actually don't needed the libs... When I read the description of the final assignment, I was excited because I assumed we will need to code EVERYTHING ourselves. So really do the thinking of how to solve the requirements, testing it in a notebook out, reading the docs, discovering new cool stuff... But unfortunately my dream did not come true. The most exciting function was already provided and some of the answers were little bit of copy and paste instead of really recalling newly learned knowledge. Before this review I really wanted to give 4 out of 5 stars but after writing this review I will now give only 2 stars.

Coursera,"Python for Data Science, AI & Development", Kshitij P,Rating: 4.5 out of 5,"The IBM cloud ""service"" leaves much to be desired. Multiple times I've experienced outages while I was in the middle of lab assignments. It's a paid course where they give you ""free"" credits to do the course work in their cloud ""service."" But the credits are inadequate for the labs and they constantly ask for your credit card to buy more ""service."" While the class is okay I wouldn't recommend it to anyone because of the poor IBM cloud support.",

The instructor never has a dull moment, and his lively communication keeps the students engaged. I recommend this course to everyone who is thinking about it or on the edge. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the lack of exercises from section 16 onwards. I enjoyed these exercises, and they helped cement the concepts.",
